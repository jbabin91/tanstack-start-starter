ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN active_organization_id TEXT;

-- Member display preferences
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN display_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN last_active TIMESTAMP;

-- Post management
CREATE TABLE post_analytics (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id TEXT REFERENCES posts(id),
  views INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  likes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  shares INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
