## Key Architectural Achievements

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Implementation

- **Declarative permission config** replaced 47 lines of if/else logic
- **Database enum inference** eliminated manual type definitions
- **Single configuration object** for all permission rules

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Implementation

- **Helper functions** eliminated 35 lines of duplicate query code
- **Single source of truth** for roles via database enums
- **Centralized permission computation** logic

### Better-Auth Optimization

- **Database hooks** compute permissions automatically with user fetch
- **Route context integration** provides permissions throughout app
- **Type-safe permission checking** with full TypeScript support

## Next Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete Dashboard Transformation** - Finish role-based dashboard components
2. **Profile Management Modals** - Build user profile editing interface
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Add test framework and coverage
4. **Performance Optimization** - Implement code splitting and caching

## Outstanding Technical Debt

- [ ] CSS build warning (TailwindCSS v4 + esbuild minification - non-blocking)

**Status**: Infrastructure and architecture phase COMPLETE. Ready for feature development phase.
