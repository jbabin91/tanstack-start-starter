  - Custom dashboards by user role

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Complete Dashboard Transformation** - Transform static dashboard to role-based components
2. **ðŸŽ¯ Build Permission Guards** - Implement role-based component rendering
3. **ðŸŽ¯ Profile Management Modals** - Create user profile editing interface
4. **ðŸŽ¯ Organization Context Display** - Show active organization in dashboard

## Key Architectural Advantages Already in Place

- âœ… **Declarative Permission System** - Easy to extend with new roles/permissions
- âœ… **Type-Safe Role Checking** - Full TypeScript support throughout
- âœ… **Database-Driven Roles** - Single source of truth with PostgreSQL enums
- âœ… **Better-Auth Integration** - Automatic permission computation
- âœ… **KISS/DRY Principles** - Maintainable, readable codebase
- âœ… **Route Context Ready** - Permissions available everywhere

## Risk Mitigation

- **Security**: Server-side permission validation already implemented
- **Performance**: Single query with computed permissions, indexed database columns
- **Maintainability**: Configuration-driven approach allows easy permission changes
- **Type Safety**: Full inference from database enums prevents role/permission mismatches

**Status**: Ready to execute dashboard transformation phase with solid foundation in place.
