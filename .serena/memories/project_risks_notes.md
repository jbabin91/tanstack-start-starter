# Project Risks, Notes & Context

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

- **Authentication complexity**: Email verification flow integration may require significant debugging
- **Database migrations**: Production migration strategies need careful planning
- **Performance with scale**: Large dataset handling needs early consideration

### Mitigation Strategies

- Start with basic auth flows, add complexity iteratively
- Implement comprehensive migration testing
- Add pagination and lazy loading early
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Important Project Notes

### Current Technical Context

- **Build Status**: Functional build with minor CSS minification warning (non-blocking)
- **Deployment**: Already configured with Coolify auto-deployment from main branch
- **Testing Stack**: Vitest + Storybook + Playwright confirmed for future implementation
- **UI Components**: All shadcn/ui components are React 19 + TailwindCSS v4 ready
- **Agent Support**: 13 specialized Claude Code agents available for development assistance

### Architecture Decisions

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM using snake_case naming
- **Authentication**: better-auth multi-session with auto-organization creation
- **Email**: Resend with React Email templates for professional communication
- **Validation**: Arktype for runtime validation throughout the stack
- **Routing**: File-based routing with \_app, \_auth, \_public structure

### Development Workflow

- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint warnings policy enforced
- **Type Safety**: Prefer `type` over `interface`, strict TypeScript
- **Import Style**: Always use `@/` alias, no barrel files
- **JSX Content**: Escape apostrophes with `&apos;` for ESLint compliance

## Recent Development History

### Major Milestones Achieved

- **Complete Authentication System**: Full email verification flow with better-auth
- **Professional Email Integration**: React Email + Resend with branded templates
- **Agent Ecosystem**: 13 specialized Claude Code agents with current coding standards
- **UI/UX Foundation**: 47+ shadcn/ui components with accessibility compliance
- **Production Deployment**: Coolify pipeline with automatic deployments

### Technical Debt & Known Issues

- **CSS Build Warning**: TailwindCSS v4 + esbuild minification compatibility (non-blocking)
- **Testing Coverage**: No test framework currently implemented (planned for Phase 2)
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and caching strategies pending
- **Security Hardening**: CSRF protection and rate limiting not yet implemented

## Strategic Considerations

### Template Positioning

This is designed as a **world-class starter template** that developers love to use, not just a basic example. Focus on:

- **Developer Experience**: 5-minute setup to productive development
- **Production Ready**: Real-world patterns and security considerations
- **Modern Patterns**: Latest React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS v4 practices
- **Comprehensive Features**: Authentication, email, organization management

### Success Factors

- **Quality over Speed**: Better to have fewer features that work excellently
- **Documentation First**: Every pattern should be well-documented for learning
- **Agent Integration**: Leverage Claude Code agents for consistent development
- **Community Ready**: Prepare for open source release with proper documentation

## Maintenance Strategy

- **Version Updates**: Keep dependencies current with automated checks
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and dependency updates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals and optimization opportunities
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep all guides current with code changes
