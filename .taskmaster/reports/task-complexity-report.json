      "taskTitle": "Setup Email Infrastructure with Resend Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down email infrastructure into: Resend API configuration, email template creation with React Email, email queue implementation for reliability, email analytics tracking, error handling and retry logic, email verification flow integration, password reset email flow, and comprehensive testing strategy. Consider the existing Resend integration already in place and build upon current email template patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to existing Resend integration foundation. The codebase already has basic email functionality with templates for verification and password reset. Main complexity comes from implementing queue system, analytics, and comprehensive error handling. Existing patterns reduce implementation complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Organization Management and Multi-tenancy",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement comprehensive organization management: extend existing better-auth organization plugin configuration, create member invitation system with email notifications, implement RBAC with granular permissions, build organization switching UI, create member management dashboard, implement data isolation patterns, add organization-scoped API endpoints, create invitation acceptance flows, implement permission-based route protection, and comprehensive testing for multi-tenancy scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive multi-tenancy requirements. The codebase has basic better-auth organization plugin setup but needs extensive member management, RBAC implementation, data isolation, and UI components. Security and data isolation requirements significantly increase complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Create Core Content Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive content management: extend existing posts schema with draft/publish status, implement CRUD server functions using TanStack Start patterns, create post versioning system, implement auto-save functionality, add content validation using Arktype, build organization-scoped access controls, create post management UI with shadcn/ui components, implement content metadata and tagging, and comprehensive testing for content workflows.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity with existing posts schema foundation. Current basic posts table needs extension for CMS features like draft/publish workflows, versioning, and organization-scoped access. Server function patterns are established, reducing API implementation complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement PostgreSQL Full-Text Search System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement advanced search functionality: configure PostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector/tsquery, create search indexes on content and metadata, implement search ranking algorithms, build faceted filtering system, create search analytics tracking, implement saved search functionality, build search UI with real-time results, and performance optimization for search queries.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity requiring PostgreSQL expertise and performance optimization. No existing search infrastructure found, requiring ground-up implementation. Search ranking, faceted filtering, and performance optimization add significant complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive dashboard interface: build responsive dashboard layout using existing shadcn/ui components, implement activity feed with real-time updates, create organization switching interface, build user profile management UI, implement session management interface, add dark/light mode toggle with system preference detection, create mobile-responsive navigation, and accessibility compliance testing.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity with extensive shadcn/ui component library available. Existing UI components and patterns significantly reduce implementation complexity. Main challenges are activity feed implementation and responsive design across devices."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Build advanced content editor: implement markdown editor with real-time preview, create media upload system with S3-compatible storage, build image embedding and management, implement auto-save functionality, add keyboard shortcuts and editor commands, create toolbar with formatting options, implement drag-and-drop file uploads, add collaborative editing foundation, implement content validation, and comprehensive editor testing.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity requiring sophisticated editor implementation. No existing editor infrastructure found. Real-time preview, media handling, auto-save, and GitHub-style features require significant development effort. Editor state management and performance optimization add complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive session security: extend existing session tracking with device fingerprinting, implement session revocation with real-time updates, create security dashboard showing active sessions, build suspicious activity detection, implement audit logging system, create session timeout configurations, build device management interface, implement location-based session monitoring, and security testing for session hijacking prevention.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity with existing session infrastructure foundation. Current better-auth multi-session setup and session metadata creation provide good foundation. Main complexity in security monitoring, suspicious activity detection, and comprehensive audit logging."

      "reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time features and threading requirements. No existing comment infrastructure found. Real-time updates, notification system, threading logic, and moderation tools require significant development effort. WebSocket/SSE implementation adds technical complexity."
