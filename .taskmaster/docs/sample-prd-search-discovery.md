The implementation includes advanced features like faceted search, personalized recommendations, and real-time suggestions with proper caching and performance optimization strategies.

**Next Steps**:

1. Review search & discovery implementation guide for technical details
2. Parse this PRD with TaskMaster: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/sample-prd-search-discovery.md`
3. Expand tasks focusing on search infrastructure first
4. Begin with Phase 1 core search using PostgreSQL full-text capabilities
