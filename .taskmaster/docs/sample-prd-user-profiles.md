# Sample PRD: Enhanced User Profile System

## Project Overview

Implement a comprehensive user profile management system with advanced features including public profiles, privacy settings, activity tracking, and social integration.

## Context

**Current State**: Basic user querying functionality exists with `fetchUser` and `fetchUsers` server functions.

**Implementation Reference**: `/docs/implementation/user-profiles.md` - Complete implementation patterns for user management features.

**Database Schema**: Full user profile schema already exists in database with bio, website, location fields ready for use.

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Profile Management (Week 1-2)

- Implement `updateUserProfile` server function with validation
- Create profile editing UI components
- Add avatar upload functionality
- Implement public profile pages

### Phase 2: Security Features (Week 3)

- Create security settings interface
- Add audit logging for security actions

### Phase 3: Privacy & Activity (Week 4)

- Implement privacy settings database schema
- Create privacy controls UI
- Add activity tracking system
- Build personal analytics dashboard

### Phase 4: Discovery Features (Week 5)

- Implement user search with PostgreSQL full-text search
- Add recommendation algorithm
- Create user discovery interface
- Add advanced filtering options

## Database Requirements

**Already Available**: Complete user profile schema in `src/lib/db/schemas/auth.ts`

**Additional Tables Needed**:

```sql
-- User privacy settings
user_privacy_settings (
  user_id,
  profile_visibility,     -- public, followers, private
  show_bio,
  show_location,
  show_activity,
  updated_at
);

-- User activity tracking
user_activity_log (
  id,
  user_id,
  activity_type,         -- login, post_created, profile_updated
  metadata,              -- JSONB for activity details
  ip_address,
  user_agent,
  created_at
);

-- User recommendations cache
user_recommendations (
  user_id,
  recommended_user_id,
  reason,                -- similar_interests, mutual_follows
  score,
  created_at
);
```

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- **Profile Completion Rate**: 80%+ of users complete basic profile info
- **Profile Updates**: 60%+ of users update profile within 30 days
- **Public Profile Views**: Track profile page visits and engagement

### Discovery Metrics

- **Search Usage**: 40%+ of users use search functionality monthly
- **Recommendation CTR**: 15%+ click-through rate on user recommendations
- **Discovery Success**: 25%+ of searched users are followed

### Privacy & Security

- **Privacy Adoption**: 70%+ of users review privacy settings
- **Security Actions**: Track email changes, password updates
- **Account Retention**: <5% permanent account deletion rate

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Avatar Storage**: CDN integration required for image handling
- **Search Performance**: PostgreSQL full-text search optimization needed
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA data handling requirements

### Mitigation Strategies

- Use Next.js Image component for avatar optimization
- Implement proper database indexes for search queries
- Create comprehensive data export/deletion workflows

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Authentication system (better-auth)
- Database schema (already implemented)
- File upload system (to be implemented)

### External Dependencies

- CDN service for image storage
- Email service for verification (Resend already configured)
- Analytics tracking (optional - PostHog integration)

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority** (MVP):

- Profile editing and public pages
- Basic privacy settings
- User search functionality

**Medium Priority** (V2):

- Advanced activity tracking
- User recommendations
- Security audit logging

**Low Priority** (Future):

- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social graph analysis
- AI-powered recommendations

## Notes

This PRD leverages the comprehensive implementation patterns documented in `/docs/implementation/user-profiles.md`. All technical patterns, API designs, and React Query hooks are pre-designed and ready for implementation. The database schema is already in place, requiring only minor additions for privacy and activity tracking features.

**Next Steps**:

1. Review implementation guide for detailed technical patterns
2. Parse this PRD with TaskMaster: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/sample-prd-user-profiles.md`
3. Expand generated tasks for detailed implementation planning
4. Begin Phase 1 development with existing database schema
