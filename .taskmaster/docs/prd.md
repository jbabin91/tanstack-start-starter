- **Routing**: File-based routing with type-safe navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Stack

- **Server Functions**: TanStack Start createServerFn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: better-auth with JWT tokens

- **Media**: Images, documents, attachments

### Relationships

- Users ↔ Organizations (many-to-many via memberships)
- Organizations → Posts (one-to-many)
- Users → Sessions (one-to-many)
- Posts → Comments (one-to-many)

## APIs and Integrations

### Internal APIs

- Authentication API (better-auth)
- Content API (CRUD operations)
- Search API (full-text search)
- Organization API (team management)

### External Integrations

- Resend (email delivery)
- Stripe (payments - future)
- Analytics (Posthog/Mixpanel - future)
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)

3. User model and basic profile
4. Email integration with Resend

## Core Functionality (Builds on foundation)

1. Organization/team structure
2. Role-based permissions
3. Basic CRUD for posts
4. Simple UI with routing

## User-Facing Features (Requires core)

1. Dashboard with navigation
2. Content editor interface
3. Search implementation
4. User settings pages

## Enhanced Experience (Iterative improvements)

1. Rich editor features
2. Advanced search filters
3. Real-time updates
4. Performance optimizations

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

### Database Performance at Scale

- **Risk**: Full-text search and complex queries may slow down
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing, use materialized views, add caching layer

### Real-time Collaboration Complexity

- **Risk**: Conflict resolution in collaborative editing
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple locking, evolve to CRDT-based solution

### Multi-tenant Data Isolation

- **Risk**: Data leakage between organizations
- **Mitigation**: Row-level security, comprehensive testing, audit logging

## MVP Definition

- **Risk**: Scope creep delaying launch
- **Mitigation**: Strict Phase 1 scope, feature flags for gradual rollout

## Resource Constraints

- **Risk**: Limited development resources
- **Mitigation**: Leverage existing libraries (shadcn, better-auth), focus on core differentiators
