## Notes

This PRD leverages the comprehensive social features implementation patterns in `/docs/implementation/social-features.md`. All server functions, React Query hooks, and component patterns are pre-designed with optimistic updates and proper caching strategies.

The database schema includes denormalized counts and proper indexing for social operations. Real-time features use WebSocket integration patterns with efficient batch processing.

**Next Steps**:

1. Review social features implementation guide for technical patterns
2. Parse this PRD with TaskMaster: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/sample-prd-social-platform.md`
3. Expand tasks with focus on MVP features first
4. Begin with Phase 1 core following system using existing social schema
