## Notes

This PRD leverages the comprehensive implementation patterns in `/docs/implementation/content-creation.md`. All server functions, React Query hooks, and component patterns are pre-designed. The database schema is complete and optimized for content creation workflows.

The implementation can start immediately with existing infrastructure and scale progressively through the defined phases.

**Next Steps**:

1. Review content creation implementation guide for technical details
2. Parse this PRD with TaskMaster: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/sample-prd-content-creation.md`
3. Expand tasks based on phase priority and team capacity
4. Begin with Phase 1 editor foundation using existing schema
