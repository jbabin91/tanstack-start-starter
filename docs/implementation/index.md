# Implementation Guides

This directory contains detailed technical implementation guides for features that are architecturally ready but not yet built. Each guide provides complete API patterns, database integration, and frontend patterns that can be implemented using the existing schema foundation.

## Available Implementation Guides

### User Management

- **[User Profiles](./user-profiles.md)** - Profile management, settings, and account features
- **[Social Features](./social-features.md)** - Following system, user discovery, and social interactions

### Content Management

- **[Content Creation](./content-creation.md)** - Post creation, editing, drafts, and co-authoring
- **[Search & Discovery](./search-discovery.md)** - Full-text search, filtering, and content discovery

### Organization Features

- **[Organization Workflows](./organization-workflows.md)** - Publishing workflows, member management, and permissions

## How to Use These Guides

### For Development

1. **Choose a feature** from the guides that matches your current development goals
2. **Review the database schema** - all required tables and relationships are already in place
3. **Implement the API patterns** - complete server functions with validation and error handling
4. **Add frontend integration** - React Query hooks and component patterns
5. **Test thoroughly** - each guide includes testing considerations

### For Project Planning

1. **Create TaskMaster PRDs** that reference specific implementation guides
2. **Break down features** into concrete, actionable tasks
3. **Track dependencies** between different implementation areas
4. **Plan in phases** - guides are structured to support incremental development

### Integration with Existing Code

- **Database schema** - All tables and relationships are already defined in `src/lib/db/schemas/`
- **Authentication** - Integration patterns with better-auth are included
- **Type safety** - All patterns use proper TypeScript and Drizzle ORM integration
- **Performance** - Includes indexing strategies and query optimization

## Architecture Principles

All implementation guides follow these principles:

- **Database First** - Leverage the comprehensive schema that's already in place
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with Drizzle ORM
- **Performance** - Proper indexing, caching, and query optimization
- **Security** - Authentication and authorization patterns included
- **Scalability** - Patterns designed for growth and extensibility

## Related Documentation

- **[API Documentation](../api/index.md)** - Current implemented APIs
- **[Database Architecture](../architecture/database.md)** - Complete schema documentation
- **[Development Patterns](../development/index.md)** - Implementation standards and best practices
- **[Architecture Overview](../architecture/index.md)** - System-wide design decisions

## TaskMaster Integration

These implementation guides are designed to work seamlessly with TaskMaster AI for project planning:

1. **Reference guides in PRDs** - Link to specific sections for detailed technical context
2. **Break into tasks** - Use guide structure to create actionable development tasks
3. **Track progress** - Mark implementation milestones as features get built
4. **Manage dependencies** - Understand prerequisites and integration points

_Each implementation guide contains production-ready code patterns that can be immediately integrated into the existing codebase._
