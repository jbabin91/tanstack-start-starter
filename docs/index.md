# Documentation

This documentation is organized using a tiered system that works seamlessly with both AI agents and human developers.

## Documentation Structure

### ðŸ“‹ Strategic Planning (`.serena/memories/`)

High-level strategic decisions, system designs, and architectural planning:

- **System Design Documents**: Comprehensive feature specifications and user experience designs
- **Implementation Roadmaps**: Phase-by-phase development plans with technical details
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed technical requirements and API designs
- **Project Planning**: Strategic decisions and architectural considerations

### ðŸ“š Technical Documentation (`/docs/`)

Detailed implementation guides, API references, and developer resources:

- **Overview**: Project introduction and getting started guides
- **Architecture**: System architecture, database schemas, and technical design
- **Development**: Setup guides, coding standards, and development workflows
- **API**: Detailed API documentation and integration guides
- **Security**: Authentication flows, permissions, and security best practices
- **Deployment**: Production deployment and infrastructure guides
- **Guides**: User-facing guides for writing, collaboration, and organization management

## Cross-References

Strategic planning documents in `.serena/memories/` reference detailed technical documentation in `/docs/`. Look for links like:

- `[API Documentation](../docs/api/posts.md)` - Links from memories to docs
- `[System Design](../.serena/memories/search_discovery_system_design.md)` - Links from docs to memories

## Documentation Automation

The documentation system includes automated hooks that:

- **Cross-reference tracking** - Automatically updates links between memories and docs
- **Phase detection** - Provides project context based on current development phase
- **Context injection** - Automatically includes relevant project status in AI interactions
