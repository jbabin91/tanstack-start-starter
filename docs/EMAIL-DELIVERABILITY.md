# Email Deliverability Guide

This guide covers how to improve email deliverability for your TanStack Start application using Resend.

## What We've Implemented

### âœ… HTML Email Templates

## DNS Configuration Required

To avoid spam folders, you MUST configure these DNS records for your domain:

### 1. SPF Record

Add this TXT record to your domain:

```txt
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

### 2. DKIM Record

Resend will provide you with DKIM records after domain verification. Add them to your DNS.

### 3. DMARC Record

Add this TXT record to `_dmarc.yourdomain.com`:

```txt
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

## Domain Setup in Resend

1. **Add your domain** in Resend dashboard
2. **Verify ownership** by adding the verification TXT record
3. **Configure DKIM** by adding the provided records
4. **Update sender address** to use your verified domain
